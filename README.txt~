   BIGRAM perplexity 53.8984761198
   TRIGRAM Perplexity 5.7106793082

3. Perplexity is 12.5516094886

4. The perplexity in both the case is same. 

5. Sample1: The perplexity is 11.1670289158
   Sample2: The perplexity is 1611240282.44
   
   Sample1 belongs to the Brown Dataset and Sample2 does not. Clearly the perplexity of Sample1 is way too lower than Sample2. This tells us that the probablity of Sample1 belonging to the Brown Data set is higher. This is because Minimizing perplexity is the same as Maximizing Probability.
